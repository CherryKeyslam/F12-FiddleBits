This is version 1 of the extension which I'm not that proud of... It's all a (as Tom Scott would say) bodge.

What you can do is select some text and click the context menu (Highlight, redify or blunt) and it will copy the code which you want for you.

It creates an input element, sets its value as your selected text and finally copies that to youtr clipboard. (Why doesn't javascript allow you to copy any
text to your clipboard without having to make an input element?)
