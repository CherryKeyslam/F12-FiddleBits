# F12-FiddleBits

Hello! This is a **firefox** extension (my first one!) which allows you to make fiddling with the dev tools of a website a wee bit easier. (Just select some text and choose a command!)

- Download all the files (From Version2) in one folder, 
- go to about:debugging on firefox,
- select This Firefox, 
- then click load temporary addon and 
- select the manifest.json!

You probably wouldn't have to go through all those if I actually took the effort and put this addon to the firefox's addon site but ahhhhh whatever!

# ***UPDATE***: 

I made a F12 Fiddlebits extension for chrome! Follow the same steps to download it as for the firefox one but this time, download the files from the
Chrome folder!
