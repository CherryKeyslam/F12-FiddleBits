# F12-FiddleBits

Hello! This is an extension (my first one!) which I made both for firefox AND chrome! As the name suggests, it makes fiddling with the dev tools of a website a bit easier!

**You can**:

-Highlight
-Bolden
-Colour Red and
- Imprint your selection using this extension.

*To use this extension, go to the directory of the browser you prefer, and then read the NOTE.txt file for intructions on how to use them!*
