# F12-FiddleBits

Hello! This is an extension (my first one!) which I made both for firefox AND chrome! As the name suggests, it makes fiddling with the dev tools of a website a bit easier!

**You can**:

- Highlight
- Bolden
- Colour Red and
- Imprint your selection on the selected text using this extension.

(Just right click the selected text and the F12 Fiddlebits context menu will appear.)

*To use this extension, go to the directory of the browser you prefer, and then read the NOTE.txt file for intructions on how to use them!*
